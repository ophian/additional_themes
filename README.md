# 2019 - Additional themes for [Serendipity Styx](https://ophian.github.io/themes/)

The themes contained here are automatically synced by Serendipity Styx 3.0 (dev) Spartacus.
An update for the Styx website will follow later, when having sorted out how to get around different branches.

## UPGRADE NOTE:

**DO NOT** use as a drop-in replacement for previous Themes. Wait for use with a current **Serendipity Styx 3.0** (dev+) Edition.
All additional_themes were **upgraded** to **HTML5**, were fixed and basically upgraded for Serendipity Styx 2.1+ revisions.
**DO NOT (!)** just drop them over previous installs!
Use the **Maintenance** :: "Theme Manager Clearance Spot" to fully clean up additional themes physically in the file system before.
**BEFORE** that, make a BACKUP COPY of personal or custom changes themes!

Please send in issues or pull requests, to keep this repository a valid, maintained and extending part for Styx.
