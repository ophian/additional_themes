$info['theme_info_summary'] = 'Raw XML output XML-Template theme for the Serendipity Styx Blog system';

$info['theme_info_desc'] = 'Simple theme from 2006, newly refurbished to work with Serendipity Styx Edition.
This theme outputs raw XML on the frontside, to make the content readable by XML-Readers.
It does still effect some minor plugin integrations on the backend side, like linktrimmer or amazonchooser,
and is more or less meant to be used in a non-too-much-extended core release blog,
though it does works with some well known plugin apps, like staticpages, freetags etc.';
