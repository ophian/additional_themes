Hello!

I'm glad You downloaded my little Nature Theme for Serendipity weblog
engine. I hope You'll use it with pleasure, same as was mine making
this theme for Serendipity Community.

It is an initial release of this theme so expect some bugs. Please,
feel free to report them to me. I'll try to fix them as soon, as it
will be possible. There will be some upgrades to this theme since
I have a lot of ideas how to improve it. Don't hesitate to mail me
Your ideas or (better) go to Serendipity's Forum Page and make them
public. I'm not a professional templates designer, I'm doing it for
pure fun and as a contribute to Serendipity Community.

Please, if You use this theme, leave a link to my blog (now resides
in page footer).

Many thanks are going to Garvin and especially Carl Galloway for their
help. Thanks guys!
